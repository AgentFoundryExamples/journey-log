# Context Aggregation Configuration
# Default number of recent narrative turns to include in context aggregation
# Must be <= CONTEXT_MAX_RECENT_N (validated at startup)
# Recommended range: 1-100 for optimal performance (default: 20)
CONTEXT_DEFAULT_RECENT_N=20

# Maximum number of recent narrative turns that can be requested in context aggregation

# Enable reading from embedded world_pois array as fallback when subcollection is empty
# This ensures backward compatibility during migration
